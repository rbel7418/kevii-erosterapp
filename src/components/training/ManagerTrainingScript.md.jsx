**[SCREEN: Show https://eroster.bellezas.co.uk/]**

**Narrator:**
"Welcome to the eRoster Manager Training Programme. I'm delighted to guide you through King Edward VII's Hospital's powerful new rostering solution. Whether you're scheduling staff, managing redeployments, or tracking workforce costs, this system will transform how you work.

Let's begin by creating your account. Navigate to **eroster.bellezas.co.uk** in your browser.

**[SCREEN: Highlight 'Create Account' button]**

Click 'Create Account' and enter your King Edward VII Hospital email address. This is crucial - you must use your @kingedwardvii.co.uk email domain for access approval.

**[SCREEN: Show password field]**

Create a secure password containing at least eight characters, including uppercase, lowercase, and a number. Once submitted, your account will be reviewed by our admin team, typically within 24 hours.

**[SCREEN: Show approval confirmation]**

Upon approval, you'll receive an email confirmation, and you're ready to begin."

## PART 2: LANDING PAGE & NAVIGATION (1:30 - 2:45)

**[SCREEN: Show RotaGrid landing page]**

**Narrator:**
"After signing in, you'll land directly on the RotaGrid - your command centre for workforce management. Let me introduce you to the navigation tabs you'll see across the top.

**[SCREEN: Highlight each tab]**

**Home** - Your dashboard for quick access to all tools.

**Rotas** - This is where you'll spend most of your time, creating and managing shifts.

**Requests** - View and approve staff leave requests and schedule change requests.

**Admin Hub** - Access advanced settings, user management, and system configurations.

**[SCREEN: Return to RotaGrid]**

Today, we'll focus on the **core functionality** that you'll use every single day: creating shifts, modifying them, adding manager comments, handling staff redeployments, and understanding how the system captures financial data automatically for centralised reporting.

These are the foundations that will make your rostering faster, more accurate, and significantly more efficient."

## PART 3: SHIFT CREATION (2:45 - 4:00)

**[SCREEN: Show RotaGrid with departments visible]**

**Narrator:**
"Let's create your first shift. The grid displays your staff members in rows and dates in columns - it's intuitive and visual.

**[SCREEN: Click on empty cell]**

Simply click any empty cell where you'd like to schedule a shift. A dialog appears instantly.

**[SCREEN: Show shift creation dialog]**

First, select your **shift code** - these are pre-configured codes like 'LD' for Late Day or 'LN' for Late Night. Each code automatically populates default start times, end times, and break durations.

**[SCREEN: Highlight time fields]**

You can customise the times if needed - simply adjust the start and end times. The system calculates working hours automatically, deducting breaks.

**[SCREEN: Highlight department and role fields]**

Confirm the department and role - these are usually pre-filled based on the staff member's profile.

**[SCREEN: Click 'Create Shift']**

Click 'Create Shift', and you'll see it appear instantly on the grid. It's that simple.

**[SCREEN: Show multiple shifts being added quickly]**

You can create multiple shifts in seconds, building your rota efficiently across days and weeks."

## PART 4: MODIFYING A SHIFT (4:00 - 4:45)

**[SCREEN: Click on existing shift]**

**Narrator:**
"Need to make changes? Click any existing shift, and you'll see an 'Edit' option.

**[SCREEN: Show edit menu]**

Select 'Edit', and you can modify the shift code, times, or even reassign the shift to a different staff member.

**[SCREEN: Demonstrate changing shift code]**

For example, if a Late Day needs to become an Early shift, simply select the new code from the dropdown. The system updates the times automatically.

**[SCREEN: Save changes]**

Click 'Save', and the change is reflected immediately across the entire system - no delays, no confusion."

---

## PART 5: COMMENTING ON SHIFTS (4:45 - 5:30)

**[SCREEN: Right-click shift, select 'Comments']**

**Narrator:**
"Communication is key in healthcare rostering. That's why we've built manager comments directly into each shift.

**[SCREEN: Show comments dialog]**

Click on any shift and select 'Comments'. Here, you can leave important notes for other managers or reminders for yourself.

**[SCREEN: Type example comment]**

For instance, 'Staff member requested early finish' or 'Cover needed for training session'. These comments are visible to all managers but remain private from staff.

**[SCREEN: Show comment indicator on shift]**

Once saved, shifts with comments display a small indicator, so you know at a glance where additional information exists.

This feature ensures critical information never gets lost in email chains or handover notes."

---

## PART 6: SHIFT DELETION (5:30 - 6:00)

**[SCREEN: Click on shift]**

**Narrator:**
"Sometimes shifts need to be removed entirely. Click the shift, select 'Delete', and confirm.

**[SCREEN: Show confirmation dialog]**

The system asks for confirmation to prevent accidental deletions. Once confirmed, the shift is removed instantly.

**[SCREEN: Show empty cell]**

The cell is now available for rescheduling, keeping your rota clean and accurate."

---

## PART 7: REDEPLOYMENT (6:00 - 7:15)

**[SCREEN: Click shift, select 'Redeploy Staff']**

**Narrator:**
"One of our most powerful features is staff redeployment. When you need to move a staff member from their home ward to another department, click the shift and select 'Redeploy Staff'.

**[SCREEN: Show redeployment dialog]**

Choose the target department from the dropdown. You'll then specify the hours being redeployed.

**[SCREEN: Demonstrate split shift example]**

For example, if a nurse works 07:30 to 12:00 on their home ward, then 12:00 to 19:30 on another ward, enter those exact times.

**[SCREEN: Show home ward shift with partial hours]**

The home ward now shows the shift with only their worked hours - 07:30 to 12:00.

**[SCREEN: Show redeployment ward with remainder hours]**

The redeployment ward displays the same staff member with 12:00 to 19:30, clearly marked as a redeployment.

**[SCREEN: Demonstrate full shift redeployment]**

If the entire shift is redeployed, the home ward cell becomes blank, and the redeployment ward shows the full shift using the original shift code.

This ensures accurate reporting - both wards see exactly which hours they're responsible for, and financial allocations are automatically split correctly."

---

## PART 8: FINANCIAL REPORTING (7:15 - 8:30)

**[SCREEN: Show shift details with cost breakdown]**

**Narrator:**
"Behind every shift is powerful financial tracking. The system captures hours, calculates costs based on staff rates, and attributes them to the correct department and cost centre.

**[SCREEN: Show redeployed shift cost allocation]**

When staff are redeployed, costs are automatically split. The home ward is charged for the hours worked there, and the redeployment ward is charged for theirs.

**[SCREEN: Show export/reports section]**

All this data feeds into centralised financial reports, giving your finance team real-time visibility of workforce costs without manual spreadsheets or data entry.

**[SCREEN: Highlight automatic calculations]**

Shift codes determine hourly rates, weighted hours for enhanced payments, and whether shifts are billable or non-billable. It's all automated, ensuring accuracy and compliance.

**[SCREEN: Show summary dashboard]**

At month-end, you'll have complete transparency: total hours worked, department-by-department breakdowns, and redeployment costs - all calculated automatically."

---

## PART 9: CLOSING (8:30 - 9:00)

**[SCREEN: Return to full RotaGrid view]**

**Narrator:**
"And that's your foundation. You now know how to create shifts, modify them, communicate through comments, handle redeployments, and understand how the system supports your financial reporting.

**[SCREEN: Show Admin Hub icon]**

In future sessions, we'll explore advanced features like publishing rotas, managing staff availability, and bulk operations.

**[SCREEN: Show contact information]**

If you have questions, your IT support team is here to help. Thank you for your time, and welcome to smarter rostering with eRoster.

Let's make workforce management simpler, together."
